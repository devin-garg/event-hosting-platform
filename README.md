# event-hosting-platform
I solely architected and developed end to end an app to manage person to person live streaming for events including on iOS, Android, and Web handling user authentication, reading and writing data to the database, payments, real time messaging and video to video feed. The project was built in Node.JS, JS, Swift, Kotlin, HTML with platforms of Heroku, PostgreSQL, Twilio, Square, Paypal, Express, and Socket.IO. Website and iOS are decommissioned but the Android App (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.streamself.streamselflive) is still on the Play store.

This project took many months to develop and is part of my goal to empower content creators during the pandemic to easily monetize their content and provide a platform for them to securely manage video to video live events with their audience.
